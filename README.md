# NCBI-HBV-GLUE
Extension to
[HBV-GLUE](https://github.com/giffordlabcvr/HBV-GLUE) that incorporates sequences from NCBI GenBank.

[GLUE](http://glue-tools.cvr.gla.ac.uk/) is an open, integrated software toolkit for management and analysis of molecular sequence data.
The HBV-GLUE project family aims to establish an open, community-maintained platform for comparative genomic analysis of HBV.

A 
[web user interface](http://hbv-glue.cvr.gla.ac.uk/) to HBV-GLUE is hosted by the MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research.
Please note that due to pressures associated with the COVID19 pandemic, this web resource - which is regularly updated - is being maintained by a skeleton crew and consequently may sometimes be unavailable. 

- HBV-GLUE synchronises with GenBankevery 24h.
- New sequences are automatically genotyped and aligned.
- Each clade has its own page where you can select sequences from that clade.
